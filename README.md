# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation
This project provides a `Binary Search Tree`. It supports various operations such as inserting, deleting, and searching for nodes, as well as printing the tree in pre-order, in-order, and post-order. The class also includes methods to count nodes, get the height of the tree, and find the smallest and largest values.

- **Insert**: Add a new value to the tree.
- **Delete**: Remove a specified value from the tree.
- **Print**: Display the values in the tree in different orders:
  - **Pre-order**: Root, Left, Right
  - **In-order**: Left, Root, Right
  - **Post-order**: Left, Right, Root
- **Search**: Find if a given value exists in the tree.
- **Count**: Get the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Get Height**: Determine the height of the tree.
- **Find Smallest**: Retrieve the smallest value in the tree.
- **Find Largest**: Retrieve the largest value in the tree.
- **Delete Tree**: Remove all nodes and clear the tree.
